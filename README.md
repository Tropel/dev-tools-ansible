# An ansible playbook for provisioning a developer work station

The tools installed are not a generic set of tools for any developer or any purpose but my personal preference used for provisioning an LXC container as a development environment.

Subject to change and to be expanded.

The node.js installation support is from https://github.com/aenglund/nodejs-ansible
